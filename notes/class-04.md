# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Links

**Links** are created using the `<a>` element. Within this element you can use the `href=` attribute to link a page.

- relative links

- qualified URLs

`mailto:` - is used to create an email link

`target="_blank"` - this attribute opens the link in a new window

You can also link to specific parts of the web page through using id attributes links.

## Layout 

CSS gives each HTML element its own *box*.

  - block-level elements
  
  - inline elements

  - containing/parent elements

**Positioning Schemes**

- normal flow
  - every block-level element has its own line, causing new block level elements to flow beneath
  - browsers default

- relative positioning
  - allows you to move an element in relation to its normal flow

- absolute positioning
  - moves the element out of its normal flow, allowing other elements to act as if it is not even there

box offset - tells browser the position of the box
  - fixed positioning
  - floating elements

**z-index** property allows you to choose which box appears on top

Fixed width layouts

Liquid layouts
