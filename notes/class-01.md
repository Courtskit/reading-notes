# HTML Basics
## HTML
Html describes the structure and content of a page simply through a text document.

HTML *hyper text markup langauge* is structured using elements which are usually made up of two tags, an opening and closing tag. These elements tell the browser the kind of information being presented within the tags. 

DOCTYPES tells the browser which version of HTML is being used.

You can comment within your code like so `<--comment-->`

An ID and Class attribute can be used to uniquely identify an element. ID attributes are only made to identify one specific element and Class attributes can be used for several elements.  

**Block Elements** appear on their own line while **Inline Elements** will appear on the same line as their neighbor elements. 

* The element `<div>` allows you to set elements together in a block-level box.
* The element `<span>` allows you to set elements together as an inline element.
* The element `<iframe>` allows you to insert a frame of another page into your current page.
* The element `<meta>` allows you to store extra information about your web page.
* The element `<hgroup>` can group together multiple heading elements.
* `<section> <article> <aside>` elements organize specific groups of text.
