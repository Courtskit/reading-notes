# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript

### HTML characteristics and elements
- headings
- paragraphs 
- bold and italic
- superscript and subscript
- white space
- line breaks and horizontal rules
- strong and emphasis
- quotations
- abbreviations and acronyms
- citations and definitions
- author details such as an address

### Introducing CSS 
- Allows you to create rules for the way each individual elements "invisible box" is presented
    - selector - selects the html to be styled
    - declaration - property + value
    - property ex. font-family or color
    - value ex. arial or yellow

- The`<link>` element can be used to tell the browser where to find the CSS file within the HTML document
- ID selector - `#note`
- Class selector - `.note`
- Universal selector - `*`
- Type selector - elements name - `h1`

### Basic JavaScript Instructions

**Script** - series of instructions

**Statement** - individual instruction or step

Comments should be written to explain what the code does.
`/* multi-line comment*/`

`/ single line comment /`

Code blocks can be used to group together statements.

JavaScript is case sensitive.

Data can be stored in a *variable*.
Data Types can include a number, a string or boolean.

An array is a variable that holds a list of values. Usually these values contain a list or some kind of similar meaning. 

Remember - values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list that starts with 0. 

### Decisions and Loops

`&&` - logical and
`||` - logical or
`!` - logical not


**If statements** evaluates or checks a condition; running a set of code depending on if the statement is true or false

- comparison operators are used to compare two operands
- logical operators allow you to combine multiple comparison operators 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes

*All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy*

Loops - for, while, do while

#### Git Commit Messages

It is important to keep your commit message relay a common style, content, and metadata theme. 

- The subject and body should be separated with a blank line.
- Subject line should be limited to 50 characters, capitalized, and not ended with a period.
- The *imperative mood* should be used in the subject line. This means to write it as a command or instruction.
- Wrap the body of the message at 72 characters and explain what and why rather than how.
